Store an array messages send to, along with a `message key`.

If the same contact has multiple numbers, send it to the first one (assuming that's the real one, rest are receptionists, mom, dad)
to the rest, *ignore* OR *send without a name*.

Use the entire word if the contact's name contains it, like *aunty, uncle, sir, dr, mama, mami, nani, nana, bhua, didi, bhaiya*

Archived Chats are not shown in WhatsApp web, so messages are not sent there.
